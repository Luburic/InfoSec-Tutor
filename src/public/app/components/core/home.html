	Welcome to InfoSec Tutor dear friend. By loading this web application into your browser you have proven that you understand that security in the information age is of the outmost importance. Let's see what information security actully is.
</p>
<p>
	According to <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/44/3542" target="_blank">the official definition</a> information security is the practice of defending information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, perusal, inspection, recording or destruction. It is a general term that can be used regardless of the form the data may take (e.g. electronic, physical). However, the most common definition of InfoSec is the practice of preserving confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. But what does any of this mean?
</p>
<p>
	Let's take a step back and discuss cybercrime. Cybercrime is crime that involves a computer and a network, where the computer may have been used in the commision of a crime, or it may be the target. Computer crime encompasses a broad range of activities:<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberterrorism" target="_blank">Cyberterrorism</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare" target="_blank">Cyberwarfare</a>, and the most interesting to us, fraud and financial crimes.
</p>
<p>
	By fraud and financial crimes we consider any dishonest misrepresentation of fact intended to trick another into doing or refraining from doing something which causes loss. The attacker will, for example, scam someone into disclosing sensitive information or login credentials, he may alter or delete stored data, or commit any kind of information theft and unauthorized transformation of data. According to <a href="https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/financial-services/publications/assets/pwc-gecs-2014-threats-to-the-financial-services-sector.pdf" target="_blank">Financial Services sector analysis of PwC's 2014 Global Economi Crime Survey</a> cybercrime is the second highest threat to the financial sector. While it's impossible to accurately estimate the annual financial loss from cybercrime, some papers, like <a href="http://www.mcafee.com/ca/resources/reports/rp-economic-impact-cybercrime2.pdf" target="_blank">Net Losses</a>, estimate cybercrime to cost the world anywhere from 200 to 600 billion annauly.

<h3>CIA</h3>
<p>
	The three main principles of information security, known as the CIA triad, are:
</p>
<ul flex-offset="5">
	<li>
		<b>Confidentiality</b> - the property, that information is not made available or disclosed to unauthorized individuals, entities, or processes;
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Integrity</b> - maintaining and assuring the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire life-cycle. This means that data cannot be modified in an unauthorized or undetected manner;
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Availability</b> - For any information system to serve its purpose, the information must be available when it is needed. This means that the computing systems used to store and process the information, the security controls used to protect it, and the communication channels used to access it must be functioning correctly;
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>InfoSec Tutor</h3>
<p>
	So what is this application about? Well, by now you should realize the danger of cybercrime and how InfoSec aims to fight it to the bitter end. We can't ignore InfoSec and all it stands for. It doesn't matter if you're a white hat hacker, or a developer, or in QA, you need to be aware of the dangers of unauthorized access to your data. Information, after all, is the key asset in the information age.

	InfoSec Tutor consists of several subapplications, like <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.overview">Crypto Tutor</a> where we teach you about the various cryptographic algorithms and their uses. Future lessons will include SocEng Tutor where we teach you about social engineering and OWASP Tutor, for web application security, IoTSec Tutor for IoT security and privacy and so on.
