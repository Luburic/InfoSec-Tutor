	So, let's talk algorithms.
</p>
<p>
	Well... not so fast. In order to explain how the two most popular algorithms based on elliptic curves work, we need to take a step back and briefly discuss elliptic curves and how we can utilize them to encrypt our private messages and digitally sign them. Keep in mind that I’ll do a very brief overview of the math here, while a more extensive explanation can be found on the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.elliptic-curves">Elliptic Curves</a> subsection.

<h3>Elliptic curves – a brief overview</h3>
<p>
	Ok, so, what exactly are elliptic curves? Well, put simply, an elliptic curve is a set of points described by the equation:
