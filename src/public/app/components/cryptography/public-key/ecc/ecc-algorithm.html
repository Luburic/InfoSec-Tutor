	So, let's talk algorithms.<br><br>
	Well... not so fast. In order to explain how the two most popular algorithms based on elliptic curves work, we need to take a step back and briefly discuss elliptic curves and how we can utilize them to encrypt our private messages and digitally sign them. Keep in mind that I’ll do a very brief overview of the math here, while a more extensive explanation can be found on the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.elliptic-curves">Elliptic Curves</a> subsection.
	<h3>Elliptic curves – a brief overview</h3>
	Ok, so, what exactly are elliptic curves? Well, put simply, an elliptic curve is a set of points described by the equation:<br><br>
	(ECC 1)	<it-math>$y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$</it-math>
