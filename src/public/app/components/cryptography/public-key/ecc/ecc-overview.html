<p>
	In this section I am going to teach you about Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC).<br><br>
	This section, like most others in the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.overview">CRYPTOGRAPHY</a> group, consists of the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.algorithm">Algorithm</a> subsection, where I'll give you a brief history of the algorithm group, explain the minimum underlying mathematics needed to understand the algorithm, and focus primarily on the actual steps of the algorithms, after which I'll draw some comparisons with the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.rsa">RSA algorithms</a> and show you some real world applications of ECC.<br><br>
	If you wish to understand the underyling mathematics of ECC more thoroughly I advise you to go to the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.elliptic-curves">Elliptic Curves</a> subsection where I explain the elliptic curves in detail, focusing on cyclic subgroups of elliptic curves over finite fields and any additional constraints needed for ECC. Don't worry, I'll include some reminders about algebaric groups and fields so you should be able to understand everything with little effort.<br><br>
	The next subsection, titled <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.demo">Demo</a>, will allow you to play with both elliptic curves and the algorithms based on said curves. You can configure the parameters of the algorithm and see some output and metrics for custom input. Here we also include some benchmark results of the algorithm we used for various sets of input.<br><br>
	Moving on, in the subsection <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.review">Review</a> we'll do just that, review. Using the knowledge you have gained through the first three subsections you'll be able to answer a questionnaire which will test your grasp on the subject.<br><br>
	Last, but certainly not least, we provide you with several links and references in the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.next">What Next?</a> subsection, which should further develop your knowledge on the subject.
