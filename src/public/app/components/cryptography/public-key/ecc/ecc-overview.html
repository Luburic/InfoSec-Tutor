<p>
	In this section I am going to teach you about Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC). Today we can find elliptic curve cryptosystems in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656" target="_blank">SSH</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6637" target="_blank">PGP</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4492" target="_blank">TLS</a>, <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Secp256k1" target="_blank">Bitcoins</a> and other protocols, cryptocurrencies and technologies.
</p>
<p>	
	This section, like most others in the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.overview">CRYPTOGRAPHY</a> group, consists of the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.algorithm">Algorithm</a> subsection, where I'll focus primarily on the actual steps of the algorithms, after which I'll draw some comparisons with the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.rsa">RSA algorithms</a> and show you some real world applications of ECC.
</p>
<p>
	However, before you jump into the algorithm you should probably check out the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.elliptic-curves">Elliptic Curves</a> subsection where I explain the elliptic curves in detail, focusing on cyclic subgroups of elliptic curves over finite fields and any additional constraints needed for ECC. Don't worry, I'll include some reminders about algebraic groups and fields so you should be able to understand everything with little effort. I should give you a fair warning, you <s>probably</s> definitely won't understand the algorithms without understanding the elliptic curves themselves.
</p>
<p>
	The next subsection, titled <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.demo">Demo</a>, will allow you to play with both elliptic curves and the algorithms based on said curves. You can configure the parameters of the algorithm and see some output and metrics for custom input. Here we also include some benchmark results of the algorithm we used for various sets of input.
</p>
<p>
	Last, but certainly not least, we provide you with several links and references in the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.ecc.next">What Next?</a> subsection, which should further develop your knowledge on the subject.
