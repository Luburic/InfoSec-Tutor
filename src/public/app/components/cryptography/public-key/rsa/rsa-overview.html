	This section is all about Rivest-Shamir-Adleman Algorithm (RSA). These days you can find RSA in many commercial systems. It is used by web servers and browsers to secure web traffic (e.g. in the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6101" target="_blank">SSL</a>), it is
used to ensure privacy and authenticity of e-mail (e.g. in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880" target="_blank">PGP</a>), it is used to guarantee remote connection in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5656" target="_blank">SSH</a>, and
it has an important role in the modern payment systems through <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3538" target="_blank">SET protocol</a>. In short, RSA is frequently used in
applications where security of digital data is a concern.

<p>
	This section, consists of the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.rsa.algorithm">Algorithm</a> subsection, where we'll show you the steps of the algorithm.
</p>
<p>
	If you wish to understand the underyling mathematics of RSA more thoroughly we advise you to go to the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.rsa.rsa-math">Math Behind</a> subsection where we provide some mathematical proofs in detail, so you can believe us that this story is true. After all, you can try to prove us wrong using a mathematical method of your choosing.
</p>
<p>
	The next subsection, titled <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.rsa.demo">Demo</a>, will allow you to play with the provided implementation of described algorithm. You can configure the parameters of the algorithm and see some output and metrics for custom input. Here we also include some benchmark results of the algorithm we used for various sets of input.
</p>
<p>
	Last, but certainly not least, we provide you with several links and references in the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.public-key.rsa.next">What Next?</a> subsection, which should further develop your knowledge on the subject.
