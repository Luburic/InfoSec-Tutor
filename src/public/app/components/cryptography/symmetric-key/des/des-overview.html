	In this section I am going to teach you about the Data Encryption Standard. DES was once a predominant symmetric-key algorithm for the encryption of electronic data. It was highly influential in the advancement of modern cryptography and is by far the best studied symmetric algorithm. At the turn of the century it was replaced by the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.symmetric-key.aes.overview">Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)</a>.
</p>
<p>	
	This section, like most others in the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.overview">CRYPTOGRAPHY</a> group, consists of the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.symmetric-key.des.algorithm">Algorithm</a> subsection, where I'll focus primarily on the actual steps of the algorithm and discuss why the algorithm isn't used today, as well as present a modification of the initial algorithm that is still secure today, called 3DES.
</p>
<p>
	The next subsection, titled <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.symmetric-key.des.demo">Demo</a>, will allow you to play with the DES algorithm in an interactive environment. Here we also include some benchmark results of the algorithm we used for various sets of input.
</p>
<p>
	Last, but certainly not least, we provide you with several links and references in the <a ui-sref="main.cryptography.symmetric-key.des.next">What Next?</a> subsection, which should further develop your knowledge on the subject.
